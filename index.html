    <!-- BODY OF STORY GOES HERE - KEEP IT CUTE!-->
        <p> When the Spanish still controlled the island of Cuba, New York City was one of the most important American cities that propelled the colony toward independence. </p>
        <p> New York City became the meeting place and the home of the likes of José María Heredia and José Martí, who has been enshrined by a horse-mounted statue at the entrance of Central Park. The Cuban flag as we know it today was also drawn up and designed in the Big Apple. </p>
        <p> But today, those Cuban ties have almost been forgotten in time. Out of the 25 Hispanic or Latino origins counted in the 2022 census, Cubans ranked 11th with only 41,029 in all five boroughs. That's enough to fill Yankee Stadium and still have seats left over. </p>
        <p> Only one small pocket stands out among the five boroughs. Zip code 10033 in Washington Heights has the highest concentration of Cubans in the city with 1,401 estimated.

        <!-- DONT FORGET EXPERT QUOTE -->
        <p> “The Cuban presence from Columbia University north to Washington Heights predates the communist era,” said José C. Moya, Professor of History and Director of the Forum on Migration at Barnard College, Columbia University. “The exiles of the 1960s settled in these neighborhoods probably because of family ties, and these in turn attracted relatives and friends in the next waves of Cuban immigration.” </p>
